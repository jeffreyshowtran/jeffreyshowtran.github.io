Aims: Sacubitril/valsartan combines renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibition with amplification of natriuretic peptides. In addition to well-described effects, natriuretic peptides exert direct effects on pulmonary vasculature. The effect of sacubitril/valsartan on pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) has not been fully defined.

Methods and Results: This was a retrospective case-series of PAP changes following transition from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) to sacubitril/valsartan in patients with heart failure reduced ejection fraction and a previously implanted CardioMEMS™ sensor. Pre-sacubitril/valsartan and post-sacubitril/valsartan PAPs were compared for each patient by examining averaged consecutive daily pressure readings from 1 to 5 days before and after sacubitril/valsartan exposure. PAP changes were also compared between patients based on elevated trans-pulmonary gradients (trans-pulmonary gradient ≥ 12 mmHg) at time of CardioMEMS™ sensor implantation. The cohort included 18 patients, 72% male, mean age 60.1 ± 13.6 years. There was a significant decrease in PAPs associated with transition from ACEI/ARB to sacubitril/valsartan. The median (interquartile range) pre-treatment and post-treatment change in mean, systolic and diastolic PAPs were −3.6 (−9.8, −0.7) mmHg (P < 0.001), −6.5 (−15.0, −2.0) mmHg (P = 0.001), and −2.5 (−5.7, −0.7) (P = 0.001), respectively. The decrease in PAPs was independent of trans-pulmonary gradient (F(1,16) = 0.49, P = 0.49).

Conclusions: In this retrospective case series, transition from ACEI/ARB to sacubitril/valsartan was associated with an early and significant decrease in PAPs.
