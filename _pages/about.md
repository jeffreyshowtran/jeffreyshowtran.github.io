I'm a general cardiology fellow at the University of Arizona, T32 research candidate, data analyst, and aspiring data scientist. In a past life, I was a professional analyst at a health policy consulting firm and then at a think tank. Since then I've become an avid investigator into how we can use data better in healthcare, ranging from statistical methods to database engineering to web applications. 

I love clinical cardiology, but I've currently placed my cardiology training on hiatus to pursue a T32 year at the UA. My goal is to create a cardiovascular database based on Banner's EHR and PACS data to serve as a basis for further clinical research as well as webapp-based clinical support tools. 

I'm proficient in R and STATA, know a bit of SAS, SQL, HTML, and CSS, and just enough python to get by.
